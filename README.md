Mach Zender Interferometer consists of two beam splitter and two mirrors.

The interferomter can be considered as a simpple optical filter:

Wavelgnth 1,3 5...transmit ouput beamsplitter.

Wavelength 2,4,6.. reflect the output beamsplitter.

One of benefits is its flat phase response, which does not distort input pulse signal.
